"""
The task is related to the reverse Polish notation. It is used for parsing
arithmetic expressions. It is also sometimes called postfix notation.

In postfix notation, operands are placed before the operation signs.

Example 1:
3 4 +
means 3 + 4 and equals 7

Example 2:
12 5 /
Since the division is integer, we get 2 as a result.

Example 3:
10 2 4 * -
means 10 - 2 * 4 and is equal to 2

The sign * stands immediately after the numbers 2 and 4, so you need to apply
to them the operation that this sign denotes, that is, multiply these two
numbers. As a result, we get 8.

After that , the expression will take the form:

10 8 -

The "minus" operation must be applied to the two numbers in front of it, that
is, 10 and 8. As a result, we get 2.

In the current problem, it is guaranteed that there is no division by a
negative number.

Input format
A single line contains an expression written in reverse Polish notation.
Numbers and arithmetic operations are written separated by a space.

The following operations can be applied to the input: +, -, *, / and numbers
modulo no more than 10000.

It is guaranteed that the value of intermediate expressions in the test data
modulo no more than 50000.

Output format
Print a singular number â€” the value of the expression.

--------------+---------------+
Sample input  | Sample output |
2 1 + 3 *     | 9             |
--------------+---------------+
7 2 + 4 * 2 + | 38            |
--------------+---------------+
