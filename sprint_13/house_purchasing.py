"""
Timofey decided to buy several houses on the famous Algos archipelago among
developers. He found n ads for sale, where the cost of each house is indicated
in Argos francs. And Timofey has k francs. Help him determine what is the
largest number of houses on Algos he will be able to purchase for this money.

Input format
The first line contains the natural numbers n and k separated by a space.

n is the number of houses that Timothy is considering, it does not exceed
100,000;

k â€” total budget, does not exceed 100,000;

In the next line, separated by a space, n house values are written. Each of the
numbers does not exceed 100,000. All values are natural numbers.

Output format
Print one number - the largest number of houses that Timofey can buy.

>>> solution([999, 999, 999], 900)
0

>>> solution([350, 999, 200], 1000)
2
